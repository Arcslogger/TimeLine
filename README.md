As global COVID-19 health restrictions begin to relax in many countries, public spaces now seem to be home to comically long lineups. Restaurants, washrooms, and even essential businesses are now hardly accessible due to long wait times and lowered indoor capacities.

Our goal is to motivate civilians to safely explore new places, without the unhygienic bustle of crowds and long lineups.

TimeLine takes crowd-sourced foot traffic data and specifically filters out attractions based on their current "busyness" levels. Users enter their location, choose the type of attraction (restaurants, museums, shops, etc.), and a radius to select from. We display only currently open locations and their ‚Äúbusyness‚Äù in a fluid, beautiful web app built from the ground up for expandability and modularity.

Though initially inspired by COVID-19 and physical distancing, our app is designed to have lasting impacts far into the future. TimeLine adds another dimension to trip planning, where adventures are also planned around local foot traffic and crowds. We hope to inspire users to explore new, local businesses while making lines a permanent thing of the past. 

Our data is also dynamically updated to show current data as time passes, meaning TimeLine will never lose its relevance. üï∞Ô∏è
